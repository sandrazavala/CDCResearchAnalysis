# CDCResearchAnalysis

## Overview

The jupyter notebook contains a data analysis using GLM , non-parametric methods, and Causal Inference to predict the chances of forming a cardiovascular disease and how air pollutants affect cardiovascular disease mortality rate.

The written pdf report describes the findings in the jupyter notebook in order to answer the two research questions:

1) Can we predict the chances of contracting a form of cardiovascular disease given certain demographics of a person in the United States?

2) Do fine air pollutants levels affect the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases in a particular area?
